                    1. JavaScript is a basic programming language that runs on the
                    JavaScript Engine in any browser. While Node JS is an interpreter or
                    runtime environment for the JavaScript programming language, it
                    requires libraries that can be readily accessible from JavaScript
                    programming to make it more useful. <br />
                    2. For one online application, JavaScript is often utilized for any
                    client-side activities. An activity might be dealing with business
                    validation, dynamic page display at a set timealways period, or a simple
                    Ajax request. For every online application, they are used for the
                    maximum amount of time. Node JS, on the other hand, is mostly used for
                    non-blocking operations on any operating system. Non-blocking
                    operations on an operating system include writing or executing a shell
                    script, retrieving specified hardware-related information in a single
                    call, obtaining installation certificate data in the system, and doing
                    a large number of defined tasks.
                    <br />
                    JavaScript may run on any engine, including FireFox's Spider Monkey,
                    Safari's JavaScript Core, and V8 (Google Chrome). As a result,
                    JavaScript programming is incredibly simple to create, and any
                    operating environment is equivalent to a full browser. Node JS, on the
                    other hand, only supports the V8 engine, which is unique to Google
                    Chrome. However, written JavaScript code may execute in any
                    environment, regardless of whether it supports the V8 engine. As a
                    result, there are no browser-specific constraints.

                <p>
                    Node.js thrives in real-time online applications that use websockets
                    and push technologies. What makes that so revolutionary? We now have
                    online applications with real-time, two-way connections, where both
                    the client and server may begin communication, allowing them to freely
                    exchange data, after more than 20 years of stateless-web based on the
                    stateless request-response paradigm. This is in sharp contrast to the
                    conventional online response paradigm, in which the client is always
                    the one to begin contact. Furthermore, it's completely built on the
                    open web stack (HTML, CSS, and JS) and runs on port 80.

                    BSON documents are used by MongoDB to hold data records. BSON is a
                    binary version of JSON documents that supports a wider range of data
                    types than JSON. Documents are then grouped into collections. If
                    you're acquainted with relational databases, consider a collection to
                    be the equivalent of a table, but without the schema. Documents inside
                    a collection, unlike entries in a relational database, might have
                    varied fields, albeit they usually all serve the same or comparable
                    function. Within a database, there are collections. MongoDB is most
                    commonly used as a distributed database on many, geographically
                    scattered servers in a cluster setup. With sharding, a MongoDB
                    database may extend horizontally across multiple servers using
                    clusters (auto-balancing).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    They also enable applications to duplicate data between servers to
                    provide high availability, thanks to a feature called replica sets in
                    MongoDB, which improves the overall performance and dependability of a
                    MongoDB cluster. Even across replica sets and sharded clusters,
                    MongoDB enables multi-document ACID transactions. That is, if a
                    connection terminates before a transaction is finished, or if any
                    command in the transaction fails, the database undoes all of the
                    changes done during the transaction. Relational databases benefit from
                    ACID compliance as well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    MongoDB utilizes the MongoDB Query Language to get data into and out
                    of databases (MQL). It has the same syntax as documents, making it
                    simple to work with for developers, but it's nowhere like as intuitive
                    as SQL, the standard query language for relational databases — and
                    many analysts would object to using the words "intuitive" and "SQL" in
                    the same phrase.

                    1. Relational databases are SQL, while non-relational databases are
                    NoSQL. <br />
                    2. SQL databases have a specified schema and employ structured query
                    language. For unstructured data, NoSQL databases use dynamic schemas.
                    <br />
                    3. SQL databases scale vertically, but NoSQL databases scale
                    horizontally.
                    <br />
                    4. NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column
                    stores, whereas SQL databases are table-based.
                    <br />
                    5. SQL databases excel at multi-row transactions, while NoSQL excels
                    at unstructured data like documents and JSON.

                    JWT is a standard that offers a concise and self-contained method for
                    securely transmitting information as a JSON object between a client
                    and a server. Because of their small size, the tokens are simple to
                    send through URL, POST parameter, or HTTP header. Furthermore, because
                    they are self-contained, they include all of the relevant information
                    on a user, eliminating the need to query the database many times.
                    <br />
                    Because it is digitally signed with a secret or public/private key
                    combination, the information in a JWT may be trusted.
                    <br />
                    <h2 className="pt-4">Authentication</h2>
                    Authentication is the primary usage of JWT. When a user logs in to an
                    application, the app generates a JWT and sends it to the user. The JWT
                    will be included in the user's subsequent requests. The token informs
                    the server about the routes, services, and resources that the user has
                    permission to utilize. Because JWT may be used across many domains, it
                    is frequently used for Single Sign On.
